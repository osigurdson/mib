# Jot key reference

Scratch pages open in normal mode with the cursor at the end; explicit files start at the beginning. The bottom line shows the current mode, any keys you've typed so far, and the line and column.

Counts work with motions and operators, such as `3w`, `5j`, `d3j` and `2dd`.

## Modes

| Keys | Action |
|---|---|
| `i` `a` `I` `A` | Insert at the cursor, after it, at the line's start, or at its end |
| `o` `O` | Open a line below or above |
| `s` `S` | Replace characters or the whole line |
| `v` `V` | Visual or visual line mode |
| `Esc`, `Ctrl+[` | Back to normal mode |

## Moving

| Keys | Action |
|---|---|
| `h` `j` `k` `l`, arrows | Left, down, up, right |
| `w` `b` `e`, `W` `B` `E` | By word, or by space-separated word |
| `0` `^` `$` `g_` | Line start, first non-blank, line end, last non-blank |
| `gg` `G` `{n}G` | First line, last line, line n |
| `f` `F` `t` `T`, `;` `,` | To a character on the line; repeat, repeat backward |
| `{` `}` | Previous or next blank line |
| `%` | Matching bracket |
| `H` `M` `L` | Top, middle or bottom of the window |
| `]]` `[[` | Next or previous Markdown heading |
| `Ctrl+D` `Ctrl+U` | Half a page down or up |
| `Ctrl+F` `Ctrl+B`, PgDn, PgUp | A page down or up |
| `Ctrl+E` `Ctrl+Y` | Scroll without moving the cursor |
| `zz` `zt` `zb` | Put the cursor line in the middle, at the top or at the bottom |

## Editing

| Keys | Action |
|---|---|
| `d` `y` `c` `<` `>` | Delete, yank, change, dedent, indent: follow with a motion or text object, such as `dw`, `ci"` or `yip` |
| `dd` `yy` `cc` `>>` `<<` | The same, on whole lines |
| `x` `X` | Delete a character forward or backward |
| `D` `C` `Y` | Delete to the line end, change to the line end, yank the line |
| `p` `P` | Put after or before the cursor |
| `J` | Join lines |
| `r` | Replace a character |
| `~` | Toggle case |
| `u` `Ctrl+R` | Undo, redo (one insert session is one undo step) |

In visual mode, `d` `y` `c` `<` `>` act on the selection, `J` joins, `u` `U` `~` change case, `p` replaces, and `o` jumps to the other end.

## Text objects

Use these after an operator or in visual mode. `i` means inside and `a` includes the surroundings.

| Keys | Selects |
|---|---|
| `iw` `aw` `iW` `aW` | A word |
| `i"` `a"` `i'` `a'` | Inside or around quotes |
| ``i` `` ``a` `` | Inside or around backticks |
| `i(` `a(` `ib` `ab` | Parentheses |
| `i[` `a[` | Square brackets |
| `i{` `a{` `iB` `aB` | Braces |
| `i<` `a<` | Angle brackets |
| `ip` `ap` | A paragraph |

## Search

| Keys | Action |
|---|---|
| `/` `?` | Search forward or backward, updating as you type |
| `n` `N` | Next or previous match |
| `*` `#` | Search for the word under the cursor |

Search is case-insensitive unless your search contains a capital letter. It also finds text inside screenshots using Tesseract-generated OCR sidecars.

## Images and links

An image is selected when the cursor is on it. Move onto its line or click it.

| Keys | Action |
|---|---|
| `gx`, double-click | Open the image in your image viewer |
| `gx`, `Ctrl`+click | Open the link under the cursor |
| `yy` | Copy the image, ready to paste into other apps |
| `d`, `Delete` | Delete the selected image from the page in normal or insert mode |
| `p`, `Ctrl+V` | Paste a screenshot from the clipboard |
| `Ctrl+Shift+C` | Copy the image's text |

Right-clicking an image also offers **Copy Text from Image** and **Open Image**.

## Insert mode

| Keys | Action |
|---|---|
| `Ctrl+W` | Delete the previous word |
| `Ctrl+U` | Delete back to the line's start |
| `Ctrl+V` | Paste text or a screenshot |
| `Tab`, `Shift+Tab` | Indent, dedent |
| `Enter` | New line, keeping the indentation |

## Command line

| `:q`, `:wq`, `:x` | Close the window |
| `:{n}`, `:$` | Go to line n, or the last line |
| `:[range]s/pat/rep/[gi]` | Substitute, with `\( \) \| \+ \< \>`, `&` and `\1` |
| `:[range]d`, `y`, `>`, `<`, `j` | Delete, yank, indent, dedent or join lines |
| `:set nu`, `:set nonu` | Show or hide line numbers |

This feature set follows [jot](https://github.com/osigurdson/jot), pinned in the
[parity report](jot-parity.md). Native presentation differs. Search selects an
image containing OCR matches and highlights matching OCR words. The font subset,
ASCII case handling and bounded regex subset are intentional limitations.
Pages and explicit files both protect unsaved changes on quit. Use `:w` or
`Ctrl+S` to save, `:wq` to save and quit, or `:q!` to discard edits.
